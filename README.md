# APCSFinalProject: Dig or Die!

Christopher Liu and Nora Archer, otherwise known by our professional label
Extreme Educators, present to you *Dig or Die*! An archeology themed game with
mechanics ripped entirely from the 2020 breakout star *Among Us* and only
available in Processing. When the game begins, you will spawn in a fresh
digsite that it is your duty to investigate. You will see a few stations where
your archeological work can be completed in the form of fun, unoriginal
minigames, but beware! The digsite may hold precious artifacts but it is also
treacherously close to collapsing so you must complete your work before the
time runs out and the excavated walls cave in. Keep your hard hat on and your
eyes on the clock... because in this game you **dig**, or you **die**.
